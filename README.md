# AgriData Explorer: 
AgriData Explorer is a complete data analysis project focused on Indian agricultural trends across crops, states, and districts.
The project begins with importing and cleaning a rich CSV dataset containing crop production, area, and yield metrics for over 70 columns.
Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key agricultural questions.
We generate visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and comparisons to uncover meaningful insights.
Advanced queries are implemented using SQLite and PostgreSQL to extract insights like top-producing states or 5-year growth trends.
Queries also explore self joins, CTEs (common table expressions), and aggregation functions for deeper understanding.
Cleaned and query-specific CSVs are exported using pandas.to_csv() for downstream use.
The cleaned dataset and query results are then imported into Power BI for dynamic visualization.
Power BI dashboards highlight production trends, yield comparison, crop correlation, and top districts.
Users can interactively explore how crop performance varies over time, region, and cultivation area.
We use SQL joins (inner/self) to analyze growth, correlations, and top-performing regions over time.
Key insights include rice vs. wheat yield, oilseed production growth, and district-wise crop strengths.
The project combines Python, SQL, and Power BIâ€”showcasing full-stack data science workflow.
It provides practical insight for stakeholders like farmers, policymakers, and agri-tech firms.
AgriData Explorer helps unlock the story behind the numbers in Indian agriculture.
